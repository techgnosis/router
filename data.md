having a server that is exposed to the internet is exciting for a number of reasons, but one is that it generates data. it can generate data in a few ways
* firewall logs showing constant inbound traffic
* p2p apps
* crypto

i think the best way for me to make this project exciting and relevant is to make the router use a variety of cloud native tools. for example..
* loki for logs
* maybe there are prometheus exporters for netfilter data
* cert-manager maybe for a public server of some kind
